## Style Guidelines:

- Choose a dark color scheme for the app.
- Primary color: A muted purple (#9D7CBF), inspired by the musical concept of 'purple haze' and evocative of creativity and imagination. This should work well in a dark theme.
- Background color: Dark grey (#2B2836), very desaturated, so the purple can stand out.
- Accent color: A muted blue (#7CB3BF), which is an analogous color and brings in an element of technology.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for navigation and controls.
- Implement a bottom navigation bar for main sections: Home, Search, Library, Settings.
